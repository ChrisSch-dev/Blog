As of recently, I have started to ask myself if I still want to continue pursuing tech in the future. I've started programming around 5 years ago, and I am happy to say that I've had tremendous success in this field. But it has gotten to a point where I wonder if switching careers would be a better decision for me.

It is by no means an easy decision to simply give up something you've spent years building up knowledge on. I've consulted many of my friends about it, and they all say to go with your gut, and if you really feel like it, then just do it. What they said is true, don't let something you started yourself be the thing that ultimately confines you to your success. 

Currently I have a few months before I decide what major I want to be in in University. Currently my top choices are English Literature/Linguistics (Eng Lit/Ling), Philosophy, Psychology/Sociology with a hint of Nursing.

For Eng Lit/Ling, I've always been interested in classics such as Shakespeare, and what not. And I'm also really interested in the development of a "language", and how they evolve to how they are now.

For Philosophy and Psychology/Sociology, I don't really have an actual reason for wanting to study in these fields, they simply piqued my curiosity, that's all.

I know what I am going to say is going to sound stupid, but I want to get into Nursing simply cause my best friend is interested in the field. Sounds extremely silly I know. But I have done my fair share of research on the field, and it has somewhat piqued my interest, just not to the extent of Philosophy or Psychology/Sociology. And I'm going to be attending a workshop about Nursing in the coming summer to hopefully learn more about the field.


But back to the tech field for a moment. Even if I do get a new career, whether it be the fields mentioned above, or other fields. I do think I will continue to remain in the tech field, but just as a side-hobby, not something that brings me food on the table. 

Hopefully I can find my new direction soon. For now... I better go back to work, I do have a report due by Friday.

Signing off,

Chris
